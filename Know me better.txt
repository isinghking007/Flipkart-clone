This Project is Basically Clone of Flipkart.com that is an ECommerce web application. 

-> I've used Angular, Html, Css along with bootstrap to desing the Frontend (UI) of the application. 

-> For API I've used DotNet Framework to deploy the web-api. 
	->I'll be using JWT authentication along with some online resources to store up the images and videos used in this
	 Project. 

-> I'll be using SQL-SERVER to work on the database related queries. 

-> In last I'll deploy this website to AWS with a dummy domain name and try to access globally.
